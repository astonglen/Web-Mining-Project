Denn natürlich ist es toll, wenn man seine Erfahrungen, positive wie negative, anderen potenziellen Bewerbern und Kollegen mitteilen kann. Oracle in Amsterdam ist ein Beispiel für ein besonders schlechtes Erlebnis, und ich hoffe, dass ich einigen einen Einblick geben kann hier besonders aufzupassen.\\r\\n\\r\\nÜber Oracle in Amsterdam gibt es bereits ca. 40 Bewertungen hier bei Glassdoor. Bisher sind alle auf Englisch, obwohl auch viele davon deutsche Bewerber/Mitarbeiter sind. Deshalb hier meine Bewertung auf Deutsch. Mir fiel natürlich auf, dass fast alle Bewertungen miserabel bis schrecklich sind. Die 2-3 positiven Bewertungen wurden dann wohl von den Führungskräften selber geschrieben. Naja, trotzdem habe ich mich darauf beworben, da die Stellenbeschrebung als \"German Cloud Sales Specialist\" interessant klingt. Es gibt auch alternative Bezeichnungen, wie \"Cloud Account Manager DE Market\". Es handelt sich dabei um ein und die selbe Stelle (bestätigte mir auch der Recruiter, dass sie die gleiche Stelle unter unterschiedlichen Bezeichnungen ausschreiben, als Köder sozusagen) nämlich als \"Account Manager\". \\r\\n\\r\\nDie Hauptgründe für einen Job in die Niederlande zu ziehen wären für mich: internationale Umfeld, sprich ausländische Mitarbeiter und nicht-deutsche Arbeitswelt/-weise. Das ist bei dieser Stelle leider nicht der Fall, sondern ein urdeutsches Umfeld: ausschließlich Chefs/Führungskräfte aus Deutschland, deutschsprachige Kollegen und die Kunden allesamt ebenfalls in Deutschland.\\r\\n\\r\\nDie Bewerbungsgespräche wurden allesamt auf Deutsch geführt, es wurde nichts auf Englisch besprochen – ich hab mich gefühlt wie in Palma de Mallorca: weit weg von Deutschland, aber trotzdem mittendrin :-) Es gibt 4 oder 5 Stockwerke und das, auf dem die Deutschen arbeiten, wird auch die \"Deutsche Etage\" genannt. Mit den Kollegen aus anderen Ländern auf den anderen Etages (Benelux, Skandinavien) hat man geschäftlich nichts zu tun; man begegnet diesen auch nur am Empfang oder an der Kantine. Dass man aber auch dort unter sich Deutschen bleibt, kann man erahnen. Nun, natürlich muss das nichts schlechtes heißen; wenn man jedoch Wert auf eine internationale Umgebung legt, dann ist das nun mal wichtig zu wissen, dass das hier nicht der Fall ist.\\r\\n\\r\\nArbeitsatmosphäre: IT-Firmen, vor allem die amerikanischen, sind normalerweise für ihre fortschrittliche, arbeitnehmerfreundlichen Umgebungen bekannt, also Open Space, flexible Arbeitszeiten, wie Gleitzeit, Home Office usw. Komme selber aus der Branche, weiß daher, wovon ich rede. Überraschenderweise ist das bei Oracle in Amsterdam nicht der Fall. Home Office sei, das betonte mir die Führungskraft, nur im Ausnahmefall und nach Absprache möglich. Was bedeutet, dass es also faktisch niemand macht. Interessant zu wissen, gerade für Pendler: als ich Freitag nach 16h das Büro verließ und einen \"Schönen Feierabend\" wünschte, machte dort niemand den Eindruck bald zu gehen; das Office war noch voll besetzt.\\r\\nWas auch merkwürdig ist und man in andern Kommentaren hier lesen kann: man muss alles selber beantragen: Mitarbeiterausweis, Handy, Laptop, Lizenzen, Berechtigungen usw. Man ist also bereits am Anfang mit so vielen Sachen beschäftigt, dass man sich gar nicht aufs eigentliche Geschäft konzentrieren kann, nämlich Kunden zu akquirieren. Stattdessen werden einem Steine/Felsen in den Weg gelegt. Dass man Schulungen oder Weiterbildungen selber beantragt okay, aber gerade wenn man neu ist in einem Unternehmen und man sich eigentlich einarbeiten möchte, will man sich doch nicht mit Sachen herumschlagen sich einen Mitarbeiterausweis zu beantragen. Für all die administrativen Aufgaben bräuchte man eine halbe Arbeitskraft einstellen. Mikromanagement von seiner besten Seite.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeim Thema Gehalt sollte man sich nicht tricksen lassen: Oracle bezahlt 50% fix, 50% variabel. Vertriebsjob, somit ist ein variabler Anteil natürlich normal. Jedoch ist der variable Anteil hier exorbitant hoch, dass ihn niemand erreicht. Rechnet also damit, dass ihr vielleicht 60, max. 70% des 100%-Gehalts bekommt.', 'Führungskräfte: Bestimmt haben sie es fachlich drauf, kann ich aufgrund eines Gesprächs nicht beurteilen. Sympathisch waren die Führungskräfte jedoch nicht. Wirkten eher gehetzt, selbst ein bisschen Freundlichkeit habe ich nicht erkennen können (obwohl ich immer wieder lächle oder einen netten, absolut business-tauglichen Spruch ablasse). Die Stimmung haben also nicht DIE, sondern ICH aufgelockert – verkehrte Welt. Die normalen Mitarbeiter waren alle sehr freundlich und offen, aber ebenso humorlos. Und glücklich wirkte dort wirklich niemand. Schade.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlles in einem habe ich vor Ort keinen guten Eindruck vor Ort gesammelt, sondern konnte die schlechten Bewertungen bei Glassdoor nachvollziehen. Mir tun die Mitarbeiter wirklich Leid, denn ein Unternehmen sollte so zu seinen Mitarbeitern sein (und das ist garantiert nicht der bekannte \"Amistyle\", sondern das ist Ar[beits]lochstyle).

One guy asked about financial systems and banking related stuff.  By the time,  my turn came it was 5:45 in the evening.  I was the last person and they seemed to be in a hurry to finish it up. I was assigned to the 4th person,  he took my CV. And asked me to introduce myself.

In-Person interview with Regional Manager, Step 5. Offer\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie Lafreniere was my recruiter. Considering Oracle is such a big company, she did a great job staying on top of things. Not only did she tell me where I was in the interview process, she provided me with helpful links to prep for the interviews. One of the best recruiters I have had in terms of reliability and updating candidates on their status in the interview process. The only negative was at the end when she said she was \"disappointed\" in me not accepting the job offer. She did say though at the end of the call that she wishes me good luck before abruptly hanging up. She should have just said she respects my decision and I wish you the best of luck.  I think she thought since the beginning of the interview process I had been planning to take another position, but that wasn\\'t the case.  I had a hard decision to make, with 2 other job offers on the table. Both of them were offering me slightly more compensation when taking into account the uncapped commission structure. Also, it is harder to advance in Oracle because it is so big, at least based on what former Oracle employees have told me. I would be gaining more skills too, things I couldn\\'t learn at Oracle. I can understand why the recruiter may be frustrated, but sometimes we have to make a decision that is best for us.  By going with another offer, I also did what was best for Oracle in the long-term. I don\\'t want to start working for Oracle and leave within a year or two years like some people have done, wasting Oracle\\'s investment in me. I think declining the offer shocked her a little bit because Oracle is so reputable and probably doesn\\'t get \"no\" on a job offer very often. I felt bad given how hard she worked. After she told me that she needed to be 100% sure I was in before submitting information so I could complete the background check, that\\'s when I told her I did not want to move forward.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the interviewers all look quite serious and intimidating and sometimes sounded so on the phone, they all were very nice. I think it is just a tactic to see how you handle stressful situations. Just read up a lot on the job description and make sure you have the relevant experience. Don\\'t just think about Oracle\\'s reputation but also what the best fit is for you.

We discussed the job description, my qualifications and interest.  I was then scheduled for first round phone interviews. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe interviewer asked no product management questions only technical questions.  He was aggressive in tone and sounded angry saying \"if I sound angry, this is my way\".  I come from engineering and services and passed.  I asked if the job managed engineers due to the technical aspect of the interview.   His said \"No, I just need to assess as the engineers won\\'t respect you if you\\'re not technical enough\". He further explained that the PM\\'s focus is on design of the features and what the software will do and engineers take care of how its done. There were no questions about PDLC, MVP, or product management. He then asked questions to get age, ethnicity and education details, even though my school was on the resume.  I managed to gracefully move on without giving personal data and redirect to the job description.  As a seasoned executive with direct reports, it is important to stay away from questions that may seem discriminatory and keep my voice tone professional. I obviously passed as I was asked to meet in person and schedule the executive phone interview.  The in person interview was the same questions as phone interview and I progressed to the executive phone interview.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout 1-2 weeks later, I had a phone interview with an executive and again, no questions about product management.  I worked at a competitor and I was asked questions about how the software design handled integration with monitoring, cloud technologies, databases, app server and analytics technologies. I answered with info on design approaches, types of integration technologies that can be used like RESTful, network and messaging technologies, etc.  It was as if he was trying to find details about the product architecture, design specs, roadmap, etc., and uncover something I didn\\'t have an answer for.  I talked about monitoring technology from HP, CA, IBM and Open Source.  I talked about the plug-ins, SNMP support, and APIs and how New Relic and Splunk supports that technology for integration with applications.  I addressed questions about real-time and near realtime design for integration, database updates and analytics.  I then asked the interviewer questions about how this line of questioning on monitoring, data layer and analytics plays into the product management role.  I thought he was going to say something about design, MVP, prototypes, experimentation as this level of detail would be necessary if this PM group participated or led those activities  His answer was surprising; he said it does not as engineering really focus on technologies to build the software.  The engineers would be more interested.  He said that he just wanted to know.  He mentioned that Oracle uses their own technologies and enables enterprise manager for monitoring, service management, etc.  At this time it was becoming apparent he was trying to find out about the competition and I scaled back and talked about realtime analytics from a product design standpoint and not the underlying technology and development approaches.\\r\\n\\r\\nI thanked him and asked about next steps.  His response was another good one.  He said Oracle wants at least one woman and he had to check the box.  He said he had others to interview and that I should check back with the recruiter.  Eventually, I was told they wanted to go another route and the reason was I did not know enough about monitoring tools.  My ability to talk about developing features to integrate with 5 Gartner leading technologies and propose design and development options was not enough.

The hiring manager reached out to me through LinkedIn and we set aside some time to talk through the role and my experience. After our conversation, he mentioned that a recruiter would reach out to set up a 20 minute chat (that I should have spoken with first). Needless to say, this is where the excitement and drive stopped. From the minute I opened my mouth, the recruiter did nothing but criticize every answer/sentence I gave, picking apart my words on how I \"should\" be answering questions in an extremely condescending manner. I understand that this may of been her way of being \"helpful\" but cutting interviewees down from the very start is not an effective way to want potential hires to come work for you. Next, I was asked two fairly illegal questions that HR folks should absolutely know not to ask. Her very first question was \"How old are you?\" Later on in the interview, a second waiting of \"do you have kids?\" was asked. When I responded \"no\", the response was \"well when you have kids, you\\'ll understand this concept better as you can apply it\". I\\'m sorry but first, what business of yours is it whether I have kids or not and second, what makes you think I want kids or can have them? I felt these were just very inappropriate and insignificant matters. Finally, the nail in the coffin was when she asked me to call her back the next day to integrate our discussion and to recap our call. After telling me numerous times she would touch base with the hiring manager and get some time on the calendar for interviews, I agreed. I spent hours that night preparing, looking forward to the next day and making sure I had blocked time out of my day to take the call. I called her back at the aforementioned time. With no answer, I left a voicemail. I also followed up with an email later that day, letting her know I was available to have the call we agreed upon. I have not heard one word from her since (3 days ago). It was handled very rude and unprofessional. If you have no plans to move forward, do not tell me to prepare and call you back the next day, only to not respond to me in any way, shape or form. Do not tell me that you will be talking to the hiring manager about setting up interview times. At least have the common courtesy to tell me you will not be moving forward and good luck in my search.
